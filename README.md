Software_Engineering_WS1415
===========================

Repository for the Game Battleship implemented in Java. This Game is a Task for the class Software Engineering. It should use several Design Patterns for the implementation.

Main task is that there are more then one at least two UI running at the same time. Therefore we implemented first a TUI and a GUI. That the GUI can be interrupted by the inputs which are inserted to the GUI the GUI and the TUI have to be event-based.

Also a task is to implement a Model-View-Controller - Architecture (MVC). With that architecture we can change entire layers with different implementations for the same problems.
